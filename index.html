    <p>Home Page: Introduction to Robotics and Its Applications
        Explore the latest advancements in robotics and how they are shaping industries and society.
        Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that often programmed to perform specific tasks, such as assembling merges engineering, computer science, and technology to create machines capable of performing various tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These robots are products on a factory line, assisting in surgeries, or even exploring distant planets. Robotics has opened new possibilities for healthcare, exploration, and personal use, leading to innovation in sectors that previously relied heavily on manual labor. industries.
        In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, machine leaming, and sensor technologies have greatly enhanced the capabilities tons, but autonomous systems capable of learning, adapting, and interacting with their environment. From robotic arms and has become a critical part of modern society of robots. They are no longer just machines following preset in manufacturing to drones in agriculture, the world of robotics is rapidly evolving

    <h1>Neuroplasticity: How the Brain Adapts and Changes</h1>
    <p>Neuropiasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize itself in response to experiences, learning, and injury. This remarkable property allows the brain to form new neural connections throughout life, enabling recovery from trauma and adaptation to new environments</p>
